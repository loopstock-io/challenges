# loopstock backend developer challenge

This is a challenge for the backend developers applying to work at [loopstock.io](http://www.loopstock.io).

For the general information about the challenges please check the [README.md](../README.md).


## Average integer calculator

The system you need to implement consists of the following components:

- Two instances of random integer generator
- A message broker
- Integer average calculator
- A SQL Database
- A basic API

All the components should be run with docker. The details of what each of the components should do are below.

You need to do the following:

- Write the simple random integer generator
- Write the integer average calculator
- Write the API that stores avarages in a SQL database and serves them to an http endpoint
- Write configuration and/or explain how to run it locally
- Describe how you would provision a set of linux machines and how'd you orchestrate, monitor and troubleshoot these services.


### Random integer generators

You need to write and run two instances of the following simple service:

- every 100ms generates a random integer between 1 and 10000
- the value gets pushed through the message broker of your choice


### Message broker

The services are communicating through a message broker. You can use any protocol and broker you like. The simpler the better.
If you donâ€™t have any preferences we suggest to use MQTT protocol. You can run MQTT broker using the toke/mosquitto image:

```
docker run -it -p 1883:1883 --name=mosquitto  toke/mosquitto
```


### Integer average calculator

The avarageing service you need to write and run:

- subscribes to the topic where generators publish the values
- computes the average integer for the last 5 seconds


### API

- Stores the 5s avarages in the database with timestamp
- exposes an http endpoint where the last 5s avarages could be obtained from the database via GET request


### SQL Database

You can use any SQL database you like. If you don't have any favorites use PostgreSQL.

- Stores the 5s avarages with timestamps via the API
- Serves simple API requests for the last 5s avarage


### Hints

At the end it should roughly look like this:

- You're free to use any languages and any libraries.

- The fastest way to get mqtt broker is to run mosquitto with docker:
    ```
    docker run -it -p 1883:1883 --name=mosquitto  toke/mosquitto
    ```

### Bonus points

* have both random integer generators coordinate with each other so that you never get the same random number from both of them at the same time
